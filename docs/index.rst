   Graphical overview of SarcAsM's capabilities. *Top:* Multi-level structural analysis of sarcomere architecture. *Bottom:* High-precision tracking and analysis of individual and average sarcomere motion.

SarcAsM (Sarcomere Analysis Multitool) is an AI-powered Python package dedicated to the comprehensive analysis of cardiomyocyte sarcomere structure and function. It empowers researchers by enabling precise, multi-level assessment of sarcomeres from microscopy images and movies. This makes SarcAsM an invaluable tool for diverse applications, including drug screening, disease phenotyping, and fundamental biomechanical studies.

Key Features
------------

SarcAsM comes packed with features designed for comprehensive sarcomere analysis:

*   **AI-Driven Detection:** Robustly identifies sarcomere features in microscopy images using advanced AI.
*   **In-Depth Structural Analysis:** Provides a multi-level examination of sarcomere architecture, including:

    *   Z-band morphometrics and lateral alignment.
    *   Sarcomere lengths and orientations (sarcomere 'vectors').
    *   Myofibril characteristics (length, shape).
    *   Cell-level myofibril domain organization.
*   **Precision Motion Tracking:** Tracks individual and average sarcomere motion with exceptional accuracy (~20 nm).
*   **Dynamic Functional Insights:** Facilitates detailed analysis of sarcomere contraction and relaxation dynamics.
*   **Intuitive Standalone Application:** Offers an easy-to-use app with an interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI), no coding required.
*   **Versatile Python API:** Includes a comprehensive Python API for custom script development and integration into existing analysis pipelines.
*   **Efficient Batch Processing:** Streamlines high-throughput studies with powerful batch processing capabilities.

Using SarcAsM
-------------

SarcAsM offers two convenient ways to analyze your data. Choose the one that best fits your workflow:

-   **Python Package:** For maximum flexibility, performance, and integration into custom analysis pipelines, we recommend the Python package:

    ‚öôÔ∏è `Python Package <https://pypi.org/project/sarc-asm>`_

    *   Ideal for programming-affine users, **handling large datasets, and achieving faster processing speeds**, especially when leveraging GPU acceleration (if available).
    *   Provides a high-level API for scripting and advanced analysis.

-   **Standalone Application:** For a user-friendly experience with a graphical interface, download our ready-to-use application:

    üíæ `Download App (Windows/MacOS) <https://github.com/danihae/SarcAsM/releases>`_

    *   **Note:** The standalone application is great for getting started quickly. However, it may take some time to start up initially. The Windows version currently processes data using the CPU and does not support CUDA for GPU acceleration.
